Abstract :



This project aims to design and implement an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes essential metrics for an e-learning platform, offering insights into course enrollments, student demographics, engagement rates, and course performance. By integrating data from multiple sources, the dashboard provides a holistic view of platform activity, allowing stakeholders to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in user behavior and learning outcomes.
With a user-friendly interface, the dashboard enables decision-makers to drill down into specific areas such as regional engagement or course-specific enrollment to understand drivers of platform success. Additionally, it includes predictive insights to help forecast enrollment trends, recognize seasonal or marketing-driven peaks, and plan future content offerings. This predictive capability empowers stakeholders to make informed, strategic adjustments based on data-driven evidence.
Ultimately, this Power BI dashboard simplifies complex information and generates actionable insights through interactive visualizations. It not only supports operational needs by streamlining data access and real-time insights but also encourages continuous improvement, positioning the e-learning platform for sustained growth and increased user satisfaction.
